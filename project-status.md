# Project Status

There are a few different sub-projects that have evolved from our efforts over the last several months. Below find the status of each. Status is one of 3 designations:

* Active Development: The project is in development. Typically this means that there are outstanding features yet to be completed. This does not necessarily mean that a lot of time is being spent on a given project. It just means that we don't consider it fully complete.
* Maintenance: The project is basically done, but there are still ongoing bug fixes, No new major releases are expected in the near future, but minor and patch releases are possible.
* On Hold: The project is no longer under development and is not being maintained.

## [Fidelity](https://www.npmjs.com/package/fidelity)

Fidelity is an implementation of the Promise/A+ API. It is interchangeable with native JS promises, as well as any that conform to the Promise/A+ specification.

**Status**: Maintenance. The API implementation is completed, and I'm pretty happy with the performance. Only bug fix releases are anticipated in the future.

## [ROI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/roi)

ROI is a small, lightweight and fast HTTP client.

**Status** Maintenance. Helio, please fill in some details.

## [Opossum](https://www.npmjs.com/package/opossum)

Opossum is a Node.js circuit breaker that executes asynchronous functions and monitors their execution status.

**Status** Active Development. At the moment, there are not really any outstanding features. But that's primarily because it's not in use, I imagine. For most of the other modules, we've been eating our own dog food and using them. But this module was written in anticipation of future needs, specifically around clustered microservices on OpenShift. If and when that need arises, we have an answer, and development effort on this project may increase.

## [Lightbright](https://www.npmjs.com/package/lightbright)

Lightbright is an experimental, module for code tracing.

**Status** Active Development. Due to its experimental nature, and the potential that it will be less than useful, it may go into "On Hold" in the future. Active development is somewhat misleading here, since only a few hours every week or so are spent on it.

## [Genet](https://www.npmjs.com/package/genet)

A code profiling tool.

**Status** Maintenance.

## [Szero](https://www.npmjs.com/package/szero)

A dependency checker.

**Status** Maintenance.
